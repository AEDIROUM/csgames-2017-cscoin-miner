Description: An implementation of the A* algorithm (development files)
 An efficient implementation of the A* algorithm meant for 2D maps,
 intended for use as a path-finding algorithm in games.
 .
 The algorithm is coded in C and includes a tightly integrated binary
 heap for its open list. This allows A*-specific optimisations to
 account for the way the algorithm works.
